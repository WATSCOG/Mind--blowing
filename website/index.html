<h1 style="color:#140101"><i> TOP TEN BEST GAMES IN THE WORLD! </i></h1>
    <hr>
   <p><i><h2>The first traces of a game invented by humans were discovered in Europe, and refer to the Bronze Age (Chalcolithic period) nearly 7000 years ago. However, we have found nothing about the rules or the way the game is played. In the Persian Gulf, we discovered the oldest game in the world: “The royal game of Ur”.   </p> 
    For video games, that person was Ralph Baer. Long considered the Father of the Video Game,
    Baer's curiosity and persistence in the 1960s made possible the development and commercialization of the interactive video games 
    and modern consoles we know and love today.  </p></body></i></h2>
